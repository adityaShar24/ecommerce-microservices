## About

This project aims to create a robust and scalable e-commerce platform using a microservices architecture. It is designed to handle high traffic, provide fault tolerance, and allow for independent scaling and deployment of individual services. This architecture enables easier maintenance, faster development cycles, and greater flexibility in choosing the right technology for each service.

The platform addresses the challenges faced by monolithic e-commerce applications, such as slow deployment times, scalability bottlenecks, and difficulty in adopting new technologies. By breaking down the application into smaller, independent services, we can improve overall system resilience and agility. The target audience includes developers, architects, and businesses looking to build or migrate to a modern, scalable e-commerce solution.

Key technologies include Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and Docker. The architecture consists of several microservices, such as a product catalog service, an order management service, a user authentication service, and a payment processing service. Each service is responsible for a specific business function and communicates with other services through APIs or message queues. This modular design allows for independent development, testing, and deployment of each service, making the platform more manageable and scalable.

## ✨ Features

## 🚀 Quick Start

Clone and run the services using Docker Compose:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adityaShar24/ecommerce-microservices.git
cd ecommerce-microservices
docker-compose up --build
```

Open [http://localhost](http://localhost) to view the application in your browser (adjust port if needed).

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.8+ (for local development)
- PostgreSQL (for local development)

### Option 1: Docker Compose (Recommended)

1.  Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adityaShar24/ecommerce-microservices.git
cd ecommerce-microservices
```

2.  Configure environment variables (see Configuration section).

3.  Run Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Option 2: Local Development (for individual services)

1.  Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adityaShar24/ecommerce-microservices.git
cd ecommerce-microservices
```

2.  Navigate to the service directory (e.g., `cd product-catalog-service`).

3.  Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

4.  Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5.  Configure environment variables (see Configuration section).

6.  Run the service:

```bash
python app.py
```

## 💻 Usage

### Accessing the Services

Once the services are running, you can access them through their respective ports:

-   Product Catalog Service: `http://localhost:5000` (example)
-   Order Management Service: `http://localhost:5001` (example)
-   User Authentication Service: `http://localhost:5002` (example)

Refer to the API Reference for specific endpoints and usage examples.

### Example: Fetching Products from the Product Catalog Service

```python
import requests

response = requests.get('http://localhost:5000/products')
products = response.json()

print(products)
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in each service directory based on the `.env.example` file:

```env
# Database configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database

# Service port
PORT=5000

# Debug mode
DEBUG=True

# API Keys
PAYMENT_GATEWAY_API_KEY=your_payment_gateway_api_key
```

### Example `.env.example` file:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://ecommerce_user:ecommerce_password@localhost:5432/ecommerce_db
PORT=5000
DEBUG=True
```

## API Reference

Each microservice exposes a REST API. Here are some examples:

### Product Catalog Service

-   `GET /products`: Get all products.
    -   Response:
        ```json
        [
            {
                "id": 1,
                "name": "Product 1",
                "description": "Description of Product 1",
                "price": 19.99
            },
            {
                "id": 2,
                "name": "Product 2",
                "description": "Description of Product 2",
                "price": 29.99
            }
        ]
        ```
-   `GET /products/{id}`: Get a specific product by ID.

### Order Management Service

-   `POST /orders`: Create a new order.
    -   Request body:
        ```json
        {
            "user_id": 1,
            "product_ids": [1, 2],
            "total_amount": 49.98
        }
        ```
-   `GET /orders/{id}`: Get a specific order by ID.

### Code Style

-   Follow existing code conventions (PEP 8).
-   Use a linter (e.g., `flake8`) to check for code style issues.
-   Add tests for new features.
-   Update documentation as needed.

## Testing

Each service should have its own set of unit and integration tests.

### Running Tests (example for product-catalog-service)

```bash
cd product-catalog-service
python -m unittest discover tests
```

## Deployment

### Docker Compose

The easiest way to deploy the application is using Docker Compose:

1.  Build and push Docker images for each service to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub).
2.  Update the `docker-compose.yml` file with the correct image names.
3.  Deploy the `docker-compose.yml` file to a server with Docker and Docker Compose installed.
4.  Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the services.

### Kubernetes

For more complex deployments, consider using Kubernetes. You will need to create Kubernetes deployment and service manifests for each microservice.

## FAQ

**Q: How do I scale the application?**

A: You can scale individual services by increasing the number of replicas in Docker Compose or Kubernetes.

**Q: How do I add a new microservice?**

A: Create a new directory for the service, implement the service logic, and add it to the `docker-compose.yml` file or Kubernetes deployment.

**Q: How do I handle inter-service communication?**

A: Services can communicate with each other using REST APIs or message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka).
